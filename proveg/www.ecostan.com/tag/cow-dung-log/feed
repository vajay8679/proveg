<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cows have a significant role in Indian culture, a land of beliefs, mythological texts, and rituals. Our country is progressing in the correct direction by taking good care of our cows. As a result, the world&#8217;s largest milk-producing country is India. However cows do more than only make milk. In their lives, cows also generate gobar (cow dung). All of us are already aware of the power of cow dung. There are many advantages to </span>using cow dung<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and one of them is the ability to prepare </span><a href="https://www.ecostan.com/cow-dung-log-machine"><b>Cow Dung log</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">out of it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that people can use to ignite a fire. Burning a log of cow dung is an environmentally beneficial method that doesn&#8217;t pollute the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, cremation is done using firewood, electricity, or LPG gas. Most Indians like using conventional cremation goods, such as dried cow dung and timber logs. </span>Cow dung log<span style="font-weight: 400;"> burning is less expensive than other methods and firewood. There is a need for at least 400kg of wood to carry out every single cremation, eventually leading to deforestation.
