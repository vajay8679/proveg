<p style="text-align: justify;">Textile recycling deserves more consideration if we want to reduce how much we send to dumps. The practice of recycling textiles dates back to the Middle Ages. However, advanced innovative ways still exist to make it more practical and prevalent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we talk about recycling clothing, a textile shredder machine is an effective instrument. <strong><a href="https://www.ecostan.com/shredder">Textile shredding</a></strong> involves passing clothing through a commercial Textile Shredder<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then reassembling the fibers.
