<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spills and splashes may occur everywhere, including during essential auto maintenance and painting chores. </span>Wood shavings<span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a sponge-like quality, allowing them to absorb liquids like paint and windscreen cleaner.</span></p>

<p><b>Using sawdust As Organic Fertilizer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we already discussed, You can make mulch from </span>sawdust<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remains from woodworking may also be used as organic fertilizer in gardens. Use homemade fertilizer to feed your flowers and vegetables and keep them wet by mixing them with a nitrogen supplement or manure to avoid rotting. Alder sawdust has a favorable effect on mushrooms.</span></p>

An excellent organic compost that will benefit gardens is the ultimate product. Adding sawdust to the composting toilet process is another novel but excellent concept. Without water or energy waste, these devices process trash using oxygen, heat, and dry materials like </span>wood working scraps<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to produce a safe, hygienic fertilizer.</span></p>
